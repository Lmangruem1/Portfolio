            <p>Hi there! My name is Lashayla. <br>I am on a journey to becoming a
                Full Stack Developer. <br>I attend University of Phoenix in their Advanced
                Software Development Certification Program.<br> This webpage that you are reading now is my 
                first project. <br>I developed it to have a place to showcase
                all of my future projects. <br>It is simply a portfolio for my work. You 
                can follow along with me to see how I progress.<br>If you would like to collab 
                feel free to contact me. I would love to add freelancing to my portfolio and make your vision a reality!
